# Site Optimization
Parent repository for all Site Optimization tests.

Each 'brand' directory is where all related Adobe Target campaigns will be located. For example, Holiday Inn Express (EX): Book Today Messaging.

Once a campaign is deactivated, and deemed a 'winner', a branch should be created and named as such (winner). This branch should then be shared with the appropriate dev team for rollout.
