# <h2>Testing and Optimization</h2>
Parent repository for all Testing and Optimization test code and campaign winners.

<h4>Repo Structure</h4>
Each 'brand' directory is where all related Adobe Target campaign code will be located. For example: EX/Book-Today-Messaging/. To avoid committing campaign-related files to the wrong directory, sub-directories should be created for each campaign.

<h4>Rolling Out Winners</h4>
Once a campaign is deactivated, and deemed a 'winner', a new folder should be created withing the test repo, and named as winner. This repo should include sub-folders with all dependent files, and shared with the appropriate dev team for rollout to PROD environment.
